# Notochord Lateral Inhibition

Code for the paper "Strength of interactions in the Notch gene regulatory network determines lateral inhibition patterning", created by Héctor Sánchez-Iranzo.

Files are organized in three folders:
- Simulations
- Linear Stability Analysis
- Image Analysis

## Dependencies
Python 3.8.8 was used to generate the code.
We recommend installing the Anaconda distribution of python and then using the file other\conda_env_spec_file.txt as explained [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#building-identical-conda-environments) to reconstruct the environment used at the time of publication of the code.
